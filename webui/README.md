# BundleGen Web UI

## :warning: This is a demo and not suitable for production

## Introduction
This directory contains a simple web UI for BundleGen to simplify the usage of BundleGen
for developers. It is provided as an example of how BundleGen could be integrated into existing systems and processes, either by using it as a command-line app directly or including it in another Python project.

## Usage
### Docker
To build and start the container, execute the `./run.sh` script. Browse to `http://localhost:5000/` to load the UI
